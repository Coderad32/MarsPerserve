Welcome

Thanks for checking out the Auto Grow Kit project! If you’d like to submit comments or feedback, we’d love to hear from you.

About the Project

The Auto Grow Kit is designed for climate-controlled High Cube shipping containers. You’ll receive the parts and blueprints in multiple shipments, allowing you to prepare your container in stages.

You supply your own container—it’s more feasible and cost-effective that way. We provide the knowledge, kits, and configuration tailored to your setup.

Easy Instructions

We include clear, easy-to-follow instructions for growers, farmers, and DIY builders. The prefab design is optimized for shipping container units and built with simplicity in mind.

Food Integrity & Security

Food security means your crops grow safely in a controlled environment. Food integrity ensures quality during the most vulnerable stages—especially during harvest.

The system supports growing multiple crops with complexity and resilience.

Growers in the network can borrow units and repay with future harvests. This shared model strengthens the community and supports the broader mission: building Auto Grow Kits and software for climate-controlled agriculture.

About Us

We’re a US-based farming innovation workspace focused on building lasting infrastructure for the next decade of agriculture.

This project is built with quality and longevity in mind. You’re welcome to fork it, remix it, and build your own Auto Grow Box—just get it done and show us what you create.
