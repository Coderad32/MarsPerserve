## About The Project

Auto Grow Kit for a climate controlled High Cube Shipping Container
You get the parts and blueprints in the mail so it takes a few shipments
while you get everything ready. You supply your own shipping container
because its more feasable to order your own. We simply supply the knowledge
and kits that are crafted for your setup configuration.

## Easy Instructions

Provide easy instructions for the user / grower / farmer
Easy to read instructions for building prefab design
for shipping container units

## Setup Food Integrity

Food security and food integrity while yielding crops
ia important because the security means you can let your crops grow
while its safe and food integrity when the crop is most vulerable 
in the final stages. Food complexity growing multiple crops.

Integrity means you can barrow a unit and payback with your future crops
each grower in the network supports the overall goal of the project and that is
to build Auto Grow Kits and building software for the climate controlled kits.


## About US

We are a US based farming innovations workspace building a future in farming
while creating infastructure that lasts for at least a decade. What I mean is that 
the project should be constructed with quality in mind for what you grow this doesnt
mean you couldnt fork the project and build your own design auto grow box in fact
do it get it done and show us what you can do.

Crop Kits

Fully pre packaged setup configs and installs for auto grow box development packages

fully assembled grow kits from the mars preserve research group.

## Features

- Plug-and-play setup with pre-configured services
- Modular architecture: sensors, actuators, UI, and logging
- Dark-themed dashboard with neon accents (React + Tailwind)
- Optional smart contract hooks for provenance or automation
- MQTT/HTTP support for sensor data ingestion
- Expo + React Native mobile companion app scaffold

## Modules Included

- `grow-core`: Sensor polling, actuator control
- `grow-ui`: Web dashboard (React + Tailwind)
- `grow-mobile`: Mobile app scaffold (Expo + TypeScript)
- `grow-chain`: Smart contract templates (Solidity)
- `grow-config`: Environment presets and calibration profiles



## Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 18
- Python ≥ 3.10 (for sensor interfacing)
- Raspberry Pi or ESP32 (recommended for hardware control)
- MongoDB or SQLite (for local logging)
- Optional: Hardhat or Foundry (for smart contract deployment)
