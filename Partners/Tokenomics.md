## Tokenomics


Tokenomics (a blend of "token" and "economics") refers to the economic model, rules, and incentives that govern a cryptocurrency or blockchain-based token. It outlines how tokens are created, distributed, managed, and used within a project or ecosystem.

In your tokenomics.md, the document describes the Mars Preserve Research Token (MPRT), including its total supply, symbol, and how the tokens are allocated. The allocation is split evenly among public sale, private sale, research and development (RND), and taxes. Tokenomics help stakeholders understand the value, utility, and distribution strategy of the token, ensuring transparency and trust in the project.
