## Pull Request

To contribute to this project, please follow the GitHub pull request workflow:

1. **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine.
3. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix:
    ```sh
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
4. **Make your changes** and commit them with clear messages.
5. **Push** your branch to your forked repository:
    ```sh
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
6. **Open a Pull Request** on [GitHub: marspreserve](https://github.com/marspreserve) with a description of your changes.

The project maintainers will review your pull request and provide feedback or merge it if appropriate.


## Create a New API Token

To generate a new API token for login and authentication, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Token Generation Endpoint**  
   Use the provided API endpoint (e.g., `/api/token/generate`) to request a new token.

2. **Provide Authentication Credentials**  
   You may need to supply your username and password or use an existing authentication method (such as OAuth or JWT).

3. **Example Request (using `curl`):**
   ```sh
   curl -X POST https://your-api-domain.com/api/token/generate \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username": "your_username", "password": "your_password"}'
   ```

4. **Receive and Store the Token**  
   The API will respond with a new token. Store this token securely; it will be used for authenticated requests.

5. **Use the Token in API Requests**  
   Include the token in the `Authorization` header for subsequent API calls:
   ```sh
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" https://your-api-domain.com/api/protected-resource
   ```

> **Note:**  
> Never share your API token publicly. Treat it like a password to protect your account and data.



# Welcome üçä Mars Preserve Research

Welcome to the DIY farming project, designed for enthusiasts who want to grow plants in a controlled environment.

This project focuses on using a climate-controlled connex box to support plant growth by managing key environmental variables such as:

- **Humidity**: Maintaining optimal moisture levels in the air to ensure plants can absorb water effectively through transpiration.

- **Condensation**: Preventing excess condensation to avoid mold, mildew, and other harmful effects on plants.

- **Temperature**: Regulating the temperature to create a stable environment for plant growth, regardless of external weather conditions.

By optimizing these variables, healthy and consistent plant growth can be achieved, enabling farmers to experiment with innovative farming techniques.

## Farming Solutions üßë‚Äçüåæ

### Auto-Growth Climate Box 

Our vision is to create climate-controlled growing solutions using modified connex boxes. These systems are designed to provide:

- **Sustainable Growth Solutions**: Supporting long-term, eco-friendly farming practices by reducing water usage, minimizing waste, and optimizing energy consumption.

- **Results-Driven Improvements**: Iterative testing and refinement of systems to ensure maximum efficiency and productivity for farmers.

- **Data-Driven Insights**: Leveraging sensors and analytics to monitor environmental conditions, track plant growth, and make informed decisions to improve outcomes.

These systems are ideal for growing food in controlled environments, enabling farmers to experiment with different crops, techniques, and growth cycles. They are particularly useful in urban areas, regions with harsh climates, or for research and development purposes.

## Sustainable Farming with the Mars Preserve  üöú

At the Mars Preserve Foundation, we develop advanced farming systems to help farmers conduct experiments and post-production tests. Our climate-engineered connex boxes are designed to:

- **Promote Sustainable Growth**: By using renewable energy sources, recycling water, and reducing the carbon footprint of farming operations.

- **Empower Farmers**: Providing tools, resources, and training to help farmers achieve their goals and improve their farming practices.

- **Enable Innovation**: Encouraging experimentation with new crops, growth techniques, and technologies to push the boundaries of modern farming.

These systems are not only designed for food production but also for educational purposes, allowing students, researchers, and hobbyists to learn about sustainable farming practices and the science behind plant growth.

---

## Learning Roadmap ‚úèÔ∏è

"Growing Forward" is our philosophy‚Äîfinding the space and time to farm effectively. Connex climate growth boxes allow farmers to:

- **Grow Crops in Confined, Controlled Spaces**: Utilize small, modular systems to grow plants in areas where traditional farming is not feasible.

- **Manage the Growth Cycle of Plants with Precision**: Control every aspect of the environment, from light cycles to nutrient delivery, to optimize plant health and yield.

- **Use Tools and Data-Driven Insights to Meet Farming Objectives**: Implement advanced monitoring systems to track progress, identify issues, and make data-backed decisions.

By combining innovation and sustainability, we aim to make farming more accessible, efficient, and scalable for farmers of all levels.

## Test Case Workflow üß≤

To ensure the success of our systems, we follow a structured test case workflow:

1. **Build the System**: Assemble the climate-controlled connex box with all necessary components, including sensors, lighting, irrigation, and ventilation systems.

2. **Manage Project Overhead**: Monitor resource usage, such as energy, water, and nutrients, to ensure cost-effectiveness and sustainability.

3. **Optimize the Workspace**: Continuously refine the layout, processes, and tools to maximize efficiency and productivity.

4. **Achieve Profitability**: Use the insights gained from testing to scale operations, reduce costs, and increase yields, ultimately achieving a profitable and sustainable farming model.

This workflow is designed to help farmers and researchers systematically improve their systems and achieve their farming objectives.
