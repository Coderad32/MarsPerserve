Introduction to the farming project at home for DIY enthusiasts.

A climate-controlled connex box modified to support life
through environmental variables such as:

- Humidity
- Condensation
- Temperature

With these variables, good plant growth is observed and expected.

## Farming Solutions

### Auto Growth Climate Box - Built Solutions

A vision of climate-controlled growing solutions
using connex boxes.

Climate-controlled connex:

- Sustainable Growth Solutions
- Results-Driven Changes
- After testing a system, iterate and improve
- Run additional test cases

A system designed to be used for growing food.

## Sustainable Farmers

At the Mars Preserve Foundation, we build farming systems for farmers to run experiments 
and other post-production (development) farming test cases.

Sustainable growth is achieved through the production of climate-engineered growth connex boxes.

## Learning Roadmap

Growing Forwards, moving forwards finding the space and making the time to farm.
Growing forward, finding the space, and making the time to farm.
Connex climate growth boxes allow plants to grow in a confined space where the farmer
can control the growth cycle of the crop. Farmers' needs regarding farming objectives
take shape when projects are managed using tools and data-driven statistics.

## Test case

1. build a system; 
2. project overhead;
3. workspace;
4. profit;
