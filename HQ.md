## Grow Food for humanity

**Growth**

Growing food for everyone can seem like an unwinnable battle
but through the process of technology templating you can find...

A work flow pattern that is suitable for your needs as a farmer
when it comes to growing your crop indoors in a controlled environment.

At mars preserve we are a collective of growers that clone and produce
crops for the intent of future generation yet to be served.

## Self Service Technolgy

**Service_technology**

With the advent of robotics we plan on giving the farmer back their
power by keeping them in the supply chain and loop.

Self service technology is about automation
from farm to table giving the customer the power
to buy invest and produce their own food crops.
